-----------------------------------------------



EXERCISE 1

1. Which methods in the LinkedQueue class are taking in a parameter of the generic type T?
enqueue


2. Which methods in the LinkedQueue class have a return type of the generic type T?

None

3. Suppose you didn't have an instance variable storing the current number of elements in the queue. How could you determine the number of elements for the size() method if such an instance variable was not available?

You could use the default .size method from linkedlists or publicly create that counter and access it from anywhere

EXERCISE 2

4. Consider the possibility of using an Array Queue or a Circular Array Queue instead of the Linked Queue being used in this simulation. Would the simulation's results be impacted by switching to a different Queue implementation?

I dont think they would impact, or at least have a major impact

5. Which of these classes/methods would you have to modify if you were going to use one of the other queue implementations?

linked queue, and linear node. just use the java default linkedlist.
